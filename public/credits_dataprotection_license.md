### Models
This implementation is build on GODEL by Microsoft, Inc.

##### GODEL
GODEL is an open source model by Microsoft. See [offical paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11309) for more information.

- the version used in this project is GODEL Large, see [huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/GODEL-v1_1-large-seq2seq?text=Hey+my+name+is+Thomas%21+How+are+you%3F)
- the model as is a generative seq2seq transformer fine tuned for goal directed dialog
- it supports context and knowledge base inputs

### Libraries
This project uses a number of open source libraries, only the most important ones are listed below.

##### Shap
This application uses a custom version of the shap library, which is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/shap/shap).

- please refer to the [thesis-custom-shap](https://github.com/LennardZuendorf/thesis-custom-shap) repository for more information about the changes made to the library, specifically the README and CHANGES files
- the shap library and the used partition SHAP explainer are based on work by Lundberg et al. (2017), see [offical paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07874.pdf) for more information

##### BertViz
This application uses a slightly customized version of the bertviz library, which is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jessevig/bertviz)

- the bertviz was introduced by Vig et al. (2019), see [offical paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05714.pdf) for more information
- there are no changes to the library itself, only to the way it is used in this project (adapted to use Mistral/LlaMa 2 instead of BERT)
